# Matters of Activity

- Developed with Unity version 2020.2.1f1

Building for WebGL:
- Switch platform to WebGL in build settings
- Set compression format inside Player Settings -> Publishing Settings to Disabled
- For cross browser compatibility: In Player Settings -> Other Settings set Color Space to Gamma and under Graphics API add both, WebGL 1.0 & WebGL2.0.
